## Exercise 3

The active selection of code is creating instances of two classes, [`Person`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") and [`Coder`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A40%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js"), and then calling various methods on these instances.

First, an instance of the [`Person`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") class is created with the name "Roseann", 2 pets, living in "Pasadena", and with hobbies of "Reading", "Traveling", and "Cooking". This instance is stored in the [`person1`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A52%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") variable.

The [`greeting`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A20%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "app.js") method is then called on [`person1`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A52%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js"), which will log "Hello fellow person!" to the console. The [`info`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "app.js") method is called next, which returns a string containing the person's name, number of pets, residence, and hobbies. This string is logged to the console.

Next, the [`addHobby`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "app.js") method is called on [`person1`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A52%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") with the argument "Gardening". This adds "Gardening" to the `hobbies` array of [`person1`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A52%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js"). The [`info`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "app.js") method is called again and its return value, which now includes "Gardening" in the list of hobbies, is logged to the console.

The [`removeHobby`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "app.js") method is then called on [`person1`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A52%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") with the argument "Traveling". This removes "Traveling" from the `hobbies` array of [`person1`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A52%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js"). The [`info`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "app.js") method is called once more and its return value, which no longer includes "Traveling" in the list of hobbies, is logged to the console.

Finally, the [`soundOff`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A30%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "app.js") method is called on [`person1`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A52%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js"), which logs a string to the console that includes the person's name, number of pets, residence, and hobbies.

The same sequence of method calls is then performed on an instance of the [`Coder`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A40%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") class named "Mike", with 3 pets, living in "Los Angeles", and with hobbies of "Coding", "Reading", and "Traveling". This instance is stored in the [`coder1`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A66%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") variable. The only difference is that the hobbies being added and removed are "Cooking" and "Reading", respectively.
