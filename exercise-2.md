## Exercise 2

The provided JavaScript code defines a class named [`Coder`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A40%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") that extends from another class named [`Person`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js"). This is an example of inheritance, a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. Inheritance allows a class to acquire the properties and methods of another class.

The `extends` keyword is used to create a subclass or child class. In this case, [`Coder`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A40%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") is a subclass of [`Person`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js").

The [`constructor`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A41%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "app.js") is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. Here, the [`Coder`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A40%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") class has a constructor that takes four parameters: [`name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A41%2C%22character%22%3A14%7D%5D "app.js"), [`pets`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A41%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%5D "app.js"), [`residence`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A41%2C%22character%22%3A26%7D%5D "app.js"), and [`hobbies`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A41%2C%22character%22%3A37%7D%5D "app.js").

In this case, it's calling the constructor of the [`Person`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") class with the parameters [`name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A41%2C%22character%22%3A14%7D%5D "app.js"), [`pets`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A41%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%5D "app.js"), [`residence`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A41%2C%22character%22%3A26%7D%5D "app.js"), and [`hobbies`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A41%2C%22character%22%3A37%7D%5D "app.js"). This is necessary because when extending a class, the child class needs to call the parent's constructor to ensure it has all the properties and methods the parent class defines.

After calling [`super`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "app.js"), the [`Coder`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A40%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") class adds an additional property [`occupation`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A43%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "app.js") and sets its value to "Full Stack Web Developer". This demonstrates that a subclass can not only inherit properties from a parent class but also add new properties.

Finally, the [`Coder`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A40%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") class defines a method [`greeting`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A46%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "app.js") that logs the string "Hello fellow coder!" to the console. This is an example of a class method, which is a function that can be called on instances of the class. This method will be available to all instances of the [`Coder`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2FJavaScript_OOP%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A40%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") class.
